# Design Patterns Examples Repository

Welcome to the Design Patterns Examples repository! This collection features practical implementations of notable design patterns in software development. Explore each design pattern's directory to find detailed examples, code snippets, and explanations.

## Implemented Design Patterns

### 1. Adapter Pattern

**Description:**
The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together seamlessly. In the `/adapter` directory, you'll find an example demonstrating the implementation and application of the Adapter Pattern in a real-world context.

**Example Directory:**
[/adapter](/adapter)

### 2. Factory Pattern

**Description:**
The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating instances of a class while allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects created. Delve into the `/factory` directory to understand how the Factory Pattern promotes flexibility in object creation.

**Example Directory:**
[/factory](/factory)

### 3. Factory Method Pattern

**Description:**
The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses. Explore the `/factoryMethod` directory to see how this pattern facilitates dynamic object creation.

**Example Directory:**
[/factoryMethod](/factoryMethod)

### 4. Observer Pattern

**Description:**
The Observer Pattern establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Check out the `/observer` directory to grasp the power of dynamic relationships.

**Example Directory:**
[/observer](/observer)

### 5. Singleton Pattern

**Description:**
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to this instance. The `/singleton` directory contains an example illustrating the use of the Singleton Pattern in scenarios requiring a single point of control.

**Example Directory:**
[/singleton](/singleton)
